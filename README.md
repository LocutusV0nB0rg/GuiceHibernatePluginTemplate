# GuiceHibernatePluginTemplate

This project is a template to facilitate the creation of plugins that use guice as a dependency injection framework and hibernate as a JPA providing library.

This project works on Spigot 1.8.8. Projects for newer Minecraft versions only need a version update in the spigot dependency.
